# Hi, I'm Taiane! ðŸ‘‹

I like to be called Tai or Duronne.

I am passionate about animals, especially cats. I am unemployed so I spend my time studying and playing with my cat named Yuumi.

I am currently studying Javascript, CSS and HTML at Rocketseat.

I don't know English, I use the translator to communicate and to develop the challenges that the Explorer course proposes.
## 
ðŸ”­ I'm working on my apprenticeship.

ðŸŒ± I'm learning:
